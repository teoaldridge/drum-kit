# Drum Kit
Drum Kit is a drum simulator which can be controlled by a keyboard or a mouse. It was made using Javascript, DOM Manipulation, HTML and CSS. 

# How it works

Each button on the screen corresponds to a drum on a typical drum kit and makes the corresponding sound when pressed. 
You can either press it using a mouse or the matching key on a keyboard.
